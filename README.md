The files I have included are text-server.cc which is supposed to take the file the client gives them and a string to be searched and then returns to the client any line which contains that string. My current file is struggling with the whole file input and output and therefore cannot do the file string parsing but it at least prints out the output if the file is invalid.

The client file has about the same functionality as above it just does not do correctly what it should.

I attempted to do the make file very close to your example however I have never actually been taught how to make one.
